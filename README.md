Java Servlets Hackathon Project
Overview
This project is a simple web application developed using Java Servlets and HTML. It accepts user input through an HTML form and processes the data using Java Servlets. The project demonstrates the use of the Java Servlet API and HTTP protocol concepts to create a dynamic web application.

Features
Accepts user input (name and age) through an HTML form.
Processes the input using a Java Servlet (SimpleServlet).
Displays the processed data back to the user.

Requirements
Before you begin, make sure you have the following software installed on your system:

Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or higher
Maven (for building the project)
IntelliJ IDEA (or any Java-supported IDE)
Jetty Maven Plugin (used to run the application locally)
Installation and Execution
1. Clone the Repository

HOW TO RUN THE PROJECT IN ANY LAPTOP
To run your Java Servlets project on any laptop, follow these steps:

Install Java Development Kit (JDK): Ensure that you have the appropriate JDK installed. You can download it from the official Oracle website or use OpenJDK.

Install Apache Tomcat or any other Servlet Container: Since you're using Servlets, you'll need a servlet container like Apache Tomcat. Download it from the official website and follow the installation instructions for your system.

Set up your IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse):

Open your IDE and create a new project or import your existing Java Servlet project.
Configure the project to use your local Tomcat server (or another servlet container). You can usually do this by adding a Tomcat server to your IDE's server configuration.
Place your project files in the correct directory: If your files are not already in the proper structure, ensure your Servlets are placed inside the WEB-INF/classes directory, and your web resources (like JSPs, HTML, etc.) are in the appropriate folder.

Configure the web.xml file: The web.xml file in the WEB-INF directory is essential for defining your servlets and mapping URLs to them. Ensure it's set up correctly.

Run the project:

Start the Tomcat server through your IDE or by running the Tomcat startup script.
Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080/your_project_name to access the project.
Test the functionality: Make sure all servlets are working as expected, and debug any issues if they arise.

These steps should allow you to run your Java Servlets project on any laptop with the proper software installed.
